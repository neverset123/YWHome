Random forest consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble (Ensemble Learning). Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction (see figure below).

* A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.

## decision trees
it is an supervised learning algorithm that based on if-else-then conditions.   
it can be binary tree or non-binary tree

* on the non-leaf node is test of attribute, each branch is the output of this test.
* on the leaf nodes are classes to be classified
* the decision process starts from the root node, test on the attribute node, and outputs to the corresponding branch until leaf node. the leaf node is the result of the decision tree. the growth of the tree stops when the max. depth or min. dataset size is reached. The final class is determined based on the predicted majority class in the dataset

### CART (Classification and Regression Tree)
dataset will be splitted based on an attribute and an attribute threshold value. Every attribute and its threshold will be evalued with cost function. Wenn the best split attribute is found, it will be used as the next node in decision tree

#### cost function
* regression: Sum Squared Error
* classificatioin: Gini Cost Function(0: best -->1: worst)
proportion=count(class_value)/count(rows)
gini_index=sum(proportion*(1-proportion))

        def gini_index(groups, class_values):
            gini=0.0
            for class_value in class_values:
                for group in groups:
                    size=len(groups)
                    if size==0: 
                        continue
                    proportion=[row[-1] for row in group].count(class_value)/float(size)
            gini+=(proportion*(1.0-proportion))                 
            return gini


## process of random forest

1.  randomly select N samples from the whole N with replacement
2.  randomly select m attributes from the whole attributes M (m<<M), the attribute to form the selection node should be selected with algorithm such as conditional entropy and information gain
3. every node in the selection tree should repeat step 2 until no split is possible any more
4. repeat step 1-3 to form multi selection trees (random forest)
### notes
* random selecting N sameple with replacement and random selecting m features from M features, so that less over-fitting
* node splitting without pruning because random sampling can guarantee no overfitting

## Bagging and Boosting

* Bagging selects sample with replacement; Boosting does not change traing data set, only the weight of each sample changes
* weight of sample in Bagging is equal; Boosting adjusts weight according to error rate (more error, more weight)
* prediction weights equal in Bagging; less error prediction weights more in Boosting
* parallel computing in Bagging is possible but not in Boosting

### variants

* Bagging+selection trees= random forest
* Adaboost+selection trees=lifting trees
* Gradient Boosting + selection trees=GBDT
