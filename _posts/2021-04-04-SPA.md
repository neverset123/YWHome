to build a SPA application there are mainly three framework available: React, Vue, and Angular, which all require Javascript. 
Blazor is a Microsoft UI framework that uses a unique approach for leveraging C# .NET and the WebAssembly framework to create SPAs running in web browsers.

## Blazor
Blazor is consist of two major projects: Blazor WebAssembly (the client-side) and Blazor Server (the server-side).

### installation
install .NET.SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/blazor-tutorial/install

### usage

    #create a blazor project BalzorApp
    dotnet new blazorwasm -n BlazorApp

### performance
since Blazor needs to download dot net runtime dll in browser, Blazor projects are slow on the client-side and have latency issues.
