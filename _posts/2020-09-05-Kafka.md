Features:
* Sequential I/O
* Memory Mapped Files
* Zero Copy based on sendfile
* Batch compression
user cases:
* IOT
* microservice logs

## components
* producer  
producer message and send it to topic
* consumer  
consume message from certain topic
* topic 
cluster of messages with same type
* broker    
kafka instance (kafka server node), every broker has multi-topic
* zookeeper 
zookeeper store meta data for kafka

## process
producer produce messages and send them to broker, leader broker receive messages and write them to corresponding topic, after receiving the leader broker send follow broker a copy, consumer consume messages in the broker

## comparasion with rabbmit
1. IOT: 
* rabbmit: data loss is unlikely to happen than kafka
* kafka: data loss could happen with high workload
2. distributed or microservice logs
* kafka is fit for async collection of full link log
