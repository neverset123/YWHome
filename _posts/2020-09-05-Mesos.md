Mesos is a cluster management platform, which allocate resource to distributed frameworks, such as Spark, Storm, Hadoop, Marathon. Mesos can provide isolated resource for different frameworks to increase resource efficiency

## process

## components
Mesos consists of 4 components: Mesos-Master, Mesos-Slave, Framework and Executor
### Mesos-Master
manage framework and slave , allocate resource of slave to framework
### Mesos-Slave
execuate command from Mesos-Master, manage Mesos-Task on current node.
Mesos-Slave send information about available resource to Mesos-Master, these resource are allocated to running framework by Allocator in Mesos-Master
### Framework
computing frames (Hadoop, Mesos, marathon) are registered on Mesos by MesosSchedulerDriver. There are two resource schedule layers: Mesos scheduler and Framework scheduler 
### Executor
executor starts tasks in framework by MesosExecutorDriver
## advantage
### resource fine-grained sharing
