## data processing
### data skewness
Data skew primarily refers to a non uniform distribution in a dataset. this causes one task takes much more time than other tasks when shuffling by key is used. Exact location of data skewness can be found with:
1) check shuffle operator: groupByKey、countByKey、reduceByKey、join
2) check logs: check which stage takes more time

#### Solution
##### Aggregate data source
* aggregate value in the key, so that one key only maps to one value
* aggregate data to generate coarse-grained data 

##### increase reduce parallelism of shuffle operations

##### Random key to realizes double aggregation

##### change reduce join to map join
eliminate the problem of data skew that may be caused by the join operation, especially when one rdd is large and the other is small
##### sampling skewed key
take out the key of skewed data to a seperated rdd
##### using random numbers and extended rdd to join
