automl can deploy thousands of models in production, with far less grunt work and hand-tuning, reducing turn-around-time drastically.

## tpot
tpot is an automated machine learning tool in python. the official user manual is here: http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/api/
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neverset123/cloudimg/master/Img20210104000151.png)
it isnâ€™t designed for automating deep learning, but rather classiccal machine learning. it is built on the scikit learn library and follows the scikit learn API. Typical user cases are: regression and classification.    
remember that: tpot does not have Reproducibility for the results!!
### usage

    tpot = TPOTClassifier()
    tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
    tpot.score(X_test, y_test)

#### example
1) MNIST

    # import the usual stuff
    import numpy as np 
    import pandas as pd 
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    import os# import TPOT and sklearn stuff
    from tpot import TPOTClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    import sklearn.metrics# create train and test sets
    digits = load_digits()
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(digits.data, digits.target, train_size=0.75, test_size=0.25, random_state=34)
    #total number of pipeline: POPULATION_SIZE + GENERATIONS x OFFSPRING_SIZE
    #the accuracy is better with more number of pipeline
    tpot = TPOTClassifier(verbosity=3, 
                        scoring="balanced_accuracy", 
                        random_state=23, 
                        periodic_checkpoint_folder="tpot_mnst1.txt", 
                        n_jobs=-1, 
                        generations=10, 
                        population_size=100)
    # run three iterations and time them
    for x in range(3):
        start_time = timeit.default_timer()
        tpot.fit(X_train, y_train)
        elapsed = timeit.default_timer() - start_time
        times.append(elapsed)
        winning_pipes.append(tpot.fitted_pipeline_)
        scores.append(tpot.score(X_test, y_test))
        tpot.export('tpot_mnist_pipeline.py')
    times = [time/60 for time in times]
    print('Times:', times)
    print('Scores:', scores)   
    print('Winning pipelines:', winning_pipes)
