* driver: analyse hql language and interact with MapReduce framework
* metastore:metastore service and data storage(relational database).metastore service is seperated with hive service
* thrift: scalable and cross-language service development
### difference with relational database
* relational database use 
Write-time mode to check data, hive uses read-time-mode 
* relational database support update/delete on one or more rows, but hive not
* hive combined with hbase can offer real-time query
## implementation
### shell

    hive –e create table test (value string)
    Load data local inpath ‘home/hadoop/test.txt’ overwrite into table test
    hive –e ‘select * from test’
