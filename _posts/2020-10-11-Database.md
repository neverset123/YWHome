## NoSQL
There are four types for NoSQL database:

    Document-oriented.
    Key-value pair.
    Column-oriented.
    Graph.

### MongoDB
* document-oriented, use json like documents with optional schemas.
* used for simpler, more unstructured data, great for app development

## SQL
### Postgresql
* traditional RDBMS (relational database management system) handling more complex procedures, designs, and integrations. Mainly used for relational data, it is object-oriented in nature
* PostgreSQL scales vertically

## HarperDB
* distributed DB with restful API and dynamic schema that support SQL and NoSQL including joins.
* HarperDB is 37 times faster than Mongo at less than half the price. HarperDB also has a native REST API, supports SQL on JSON, and can be easier to use and manage
* MongoDB and HarperDB are more distributed architectures, whereas PostgreSQL might be considered a monolithic architecture.
* HarperDB uses a simple pub-sub model; data is replicated by publishing data to different “chat rooms” which different nodes subscribe to and are able to be distributed horizontally.
* Both MongoDB and HarperDB scale horizontally
* HarperDB is not recommended when you need full-text indexing, highly structured relational data, strict consistency across systems, or for projects where developers are not trusted to constrain and maintain data
