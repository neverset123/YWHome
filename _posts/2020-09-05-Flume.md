flume is a distributed reliable highly massive log collection aggregation and transmission system
# flume OG
flume OG utilizes architecture in layer: Agent, Collector and Storage

## Agent
agent collect data to generate data flow
### collect data
* push sources
extern system push data to flume
* polling sources
flume collects data from extern system with polling
## Collector
collector aggregate data
## Storage
Storage is an storage system, it can be file, hdfs, hive, hbase or other distributed storage system
## Master
master coordinate and configure agent and collector
flume implement multi-master and ZooKeeper to keep configuration consistency and high availability
# flume NG
consist of source, sink and channel

## source
accept data from data geenrator and send data to one or more channel in flume event format
## channel
it is a temporary storage container
* MemoryChannel
high speed intake
* MemoryRecoverChannel
* FileChannel
it save data to disks to keep data completeness and consistency
## sink
send data to storage system in specified time interval
